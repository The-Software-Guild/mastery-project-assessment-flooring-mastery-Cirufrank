 * to retrieve and add products to the "Data/Orders.txt" file
 * 
 * NOTE: We can use the java.io.File class' file/directoryInstance.list()
 * method to return an array of strings for the directory specified
 * an continue to load all orders from that file until the orders have 
 * all been saved to the current export
 * 
 * The audit file will keep track of all changes so the orders date 
 * appropriate file will be responsible for maintaining all order 
 * information and the Backup/DataExport.txt file will be 
 * created based on the order's information
 * 
 * An order's date will be found by getting the last 8 characters from
 * its .txt file's name (since these will represent the date the order
 * was added in MMDDYYYY format)
