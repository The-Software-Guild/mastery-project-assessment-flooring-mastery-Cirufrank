 * @description This enum represents the availability of the states within
 * our application
 * 
 * AVAILABLE represents a state being available for product/service purchase 
 * as well as a product being available for purchase 
 * 
 * UNAVIALABLE represents a state our services/products are not 
 * available to as well as products that are no longer sold
 * 
 * This allows us to retain the request data of states that were made 
 * available after enough requests were made
 * 
 * This also allows us to retain the information of products that were 
 * once available for purchase and are no longer available
 * 
 * The total orders purchased from available states can be calculated by 
 * counting the unique number of order IDs grouped by state
